`eci.dll` exports the names IBM published, so a program written against IBM's library -- a screen reader add-on, for instance -- can load ours instead. It wants nothing but the system's own DLLs, and `eci.ini` goes beside it because add-ons look for one.

There is one of each bitness, in `eci-x86_64` and `eci-x86`, and which you want depends on the add-on rather than on Windows. An add-on that loads the engine into the screen reader's own process wants the reader's bitness -- sixty-four bit for NVDA 2026. The most used driver, davidacm/NVDA-IBMTTS-Driver, hosts the engine in a thirty-two bit process of its own whatever the reader is, so that one wants `eci-x86`. Copy the contents of the folder, not the folder.

`evvspeak.exe` is the speak window: type something, pick one of the eight voices, set the rate in words a minute, and hear it. `evv.exe` is the same engine on the command line. Both are one file, sixty-four bit, and want nothing installed.

The audio is byte for byte what IBM's own binary produces, over all 81 test cases, from this build.

NOTICE says which parts of this are ours and which are IBM's: the engine is a reimplementation, and the language data it speaks with is IBM's, which the MIT licence does not cover.
