# `make' builds build/evv, which speaks a sentence into a wave file, and the

# no Python unless the rules are wanted as C.
#
# `make probe' builds the driver the tests drive instead. It is the same
# engine with a different front: it prints what the engine answered at every
# step so that test/suite.sh can set those answers against IBM's own binary
# line for line, which is why it is not the thing a person would run.
#
# `make evv32' and `make probe32' build the same two thirty-two bit. That
# build is kept because a difference between the word sizes is a layout
# mistake caught early, and it costs about a minute. It needs a thirty-two
# bit compiler, which is CC32 below.
#
# `make missing' says what our code asks for that nothing of ours answers.
# It answers nothing now, and it is worth re-running whenever a source is
# added, since a name that reappears there is a call that has quietly gone
# back to the original.

# Said rather than left to the order of the file, because a rule that has to
# sit above `all' -- the language list is one -- would otherwise be what a bare
