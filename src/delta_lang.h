/* One language, as everything outside it sees it.
 *
 * A language module is a pile of tables -- the rules as bytecode, the
 * constants they name by address, the statement table, the variable list,
 * the settings the engine carries in its image -- and until now there was
 * one of each and the engine reached them by name. Two languages cannot be
 * linked that way: every module gives its tables the same names, because
 * they are IBM's names and IBM built one library per language.
 *
 * So each module now names its own tables after itself -- `enus_vstmtbl',
 * `dede_vstmtbl' -- and gathers them into one of these, which is the only
 * name the engine knows it by. tools/gen-lang.py writes that gathering.
 *
 * How the engine finds the right one is the other half. Almost everything
 * that reads a table is a primitive the rules call, and a good many of those
 * are handed nothing but the value they are working on: STMTYP takes a kind
 * and nothing else. There is no argument to carry the language in, so the
 * language in force is kept per thread and set around anything that runs the
 * machine -- delta_run_rule, and the few places the engine drives it
 * directly. delta.h turns `vstmtbl' and its neighbours into reaches through
 * that, so the four thousand sites that read one did not have to change and
 * cannot quietly read the wrong language's.
 *
 * Per thread rather than per program because two instances speaking two
 * languages have a thread each. Nothing here is a lock: a thread sets the
 * language it is about to run and puts back what was there, the way the
 * arena's own thread-local free lists work.
