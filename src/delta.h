/* The Delta machine's working state: one allocation, named fields first and
 * then a cell for every global the language declares.
 *
 * How big it is therefore depends on which language the machine is for --
 * English runs to 0x1088 and German to 0x10b4 -- so the struct below stops
 * where the named fields do, at DG_BASE, and the cells are the rest of an
 * allocation whose size the language states. Nothing takes sizeof this.
 *
 * Named fields are ones a decoded primitive touches. As with the synthesizer,
 * the pad arrays are sized by the distance between offsets we do know, so
 * naming more of them later cannot move anything already placed, and the
 * offsetof assertions in delta.c hold every field where it belongs.
