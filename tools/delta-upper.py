"""A rule as what it does, compiled into the notation the machine runs.

The lower notation in tools/delta-lower.py is one line to one operation, which
is what makes it exact and what makes it long: of the 322,890 operations in
English's 1,042 real rules, 202,000 are the argument stack being written out by
hand -- pushes, pops and the calls between them -- and 53,000 more are a
comparison setting the flags in one line and a branch reading them in the next.
None of that says anything about a language.

This is the form above it. It keeps every call exactly as it is, the same entry
with the same arguments in the same order, because a form that reworded what a
rule calls would be describing the rule rather than being it. What it takes
over is the machine: the argument stack, the flags, where in the frame a local
sits, the landing place, the entry and the two ways out, and the numbered
dispatch a rule backtracks through.

The frame. A rule hands the machine five places in its own frame and the
machine writes to all five, so their sizes are not ours to choose: the record
ventproc fills in is 92 bytes, the landing place it plants is 64, and the three
fence arrays are 12 each, which is room for a statement type per byte and ten
is all English declares. Those sit at the bottom, the locals a rule declares
sit above them, and the last word of the frame is the count backtrack_function
is handed. Every rule IBM compiled has that shape, measured over all 1,042.

The tags. A rule backtracks by planting a choice point that carries a small
number and then asking backtrack_function what number came back; the answer
says where to carry on, and -1 says the rule has run out of alternatives. So a
plant is a place in the rule plus a number, and getting the numbers to agree
with the dispatch is exactly the sort of bookkeeping that goes wrong quietly.
Here a plant names a place and the number is the compiler's business.

What it does not do is choose registers well or move anything it does not have
to. There is no reason to: the same rules run either as bytecode or as the C a
decompiler writes out of that bytecode, and neither cares which of the eight
registers held a value on the way. So r0 carries every answer, as the machine
already says it does, and r1 to r5 widen a narrow argument on the way to a
call.

What it does not attempt is a form for the rules as patterns. The census says
why: a median real rule is 28 calls over 15 blocks, only 4% merely test and
assign, and there are 1,058 distinct shapes between the 1,042. They are
programs, and this is a form for writing programs with the machine's
bookkeeping taken off.
