"""A language's phonemes, from the three places they live.

A phoneme is in three places at once and none of them alone says what it is.

Its name is a value of the phone statement's first field, in
`lang/<tag>/<tag>.statements`, and that is the list the rules index by. Its
numbers are a `Phoneme` line in `lang/<tag>/<tag>.settings`: four bytes of name
and then eleven values, which is what a caller handing the engine phonemes
rather than text is read against. And what it sounds like is a rule --
`<x>_ph_<name>` -- which sets the source parameters and calls one locus rule
for the place it is articulated at, `<x>_<place>_Fv`, where the formant targets
are.

So this puts the three beside each other: every phoneme the language declares,
whether it has numbers, whether it has a rule, and which place that rule speaks
it at. What it is for is adding one, which means having somewhere to copy from
and knowing what a copy has to cover.

A phoneme also carries a record saying what kind of sound it is, in the same
place a letter's does: the `variants' bytes of its own statement, one record
per name, and the statement says how long one is. For the phone statement they
are its own fields -- class, voicing, sonority, manner, place, and the three a
vowel wants -- so `place' is where a language says that its sz is retroflex and
its s is not. Reading those by eye and writing them by hand is how a fricative
quietly becomes a lateral, so `set' writes them by name.

usage: lang-phonemes.py <tag>            every phoneme
       lang-phonemes.py <tag> <name>...  only the ones named
       lang-phonemes.py set <tag> <phoneme> <field>=<value>...
       lang-phonemes.py add <tag> <name> <field>=<value>...

`add' puts a phoneme on the end, which is the only place one can go: the codes
below it are what every rule and every dictionary entry already say. It is the
last resort rather than the first -- a code that has never existed is invisible
to every rule that asks what its neighbours are, so retaking one the language
cannot reach is the better move where there is one to retake.
